            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h3>032c is a media and fashion company for the 21st century. Founded by Joerg Koch in 2000, 032c began as a magazine in Berlin. Now the brand also creates ready-to-wear collections and community-catalysing experiences on a global scale. The mission of every 032c production is to inform, provoke, and activate the imagination. The 032c universe is a place for freedom, research, and creativity, where fantasy is reality, aspiration is attainment, and everything is culture in the making. And, like any universe, 032c is expanding.
